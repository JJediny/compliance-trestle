Organizations determine the content of awareness training based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for security and privacy and actions by users to maintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content addresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable information.\nAwareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Awareness training after the initial training described in AT-2a.1, is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent awareness training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent attack schemes; changes to organizational security and privacy policies; revised security and privacy expectations; or a subset of topics from the initial training. Updating awareness training on a regular basis helps to ensure the content remains relevant and effective."

Personnel are trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to suspicious email or web communications. For this process to work effectively, personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors in systems can provide organizations with early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of anomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement malicious code detection and protection tools and systems employed by organizations."
